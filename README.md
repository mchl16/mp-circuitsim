# Overview
A circuit simulator created for the "Methods of programming" (https://zapisy.ii.uni.wroc.pl/courses/metody-programowania-202122-letni) course during the first year of university.

# How to run
Use the DrRacket IDE to run the project. I provided a few sample tests in the `tests.rkt` file.
