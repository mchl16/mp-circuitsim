# Overview
A circuit simulator created for the "Methods of programming" () course during the first year of university.

# How to run
Use the DrRacket IDE to run the project. I provided a few tests (mine are in the `tests.rkt` file, the other ones are _stolen_ from the university CS Discord channel).
